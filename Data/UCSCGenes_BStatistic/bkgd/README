Background selection (B) value estimates calculated using gcons
conserved segments (score > 10) and a finescale recombination map
(Myers et al. 2005). Coordinates are for NCBI36/hg18 version of the
human genome assembly.

Each line contains two space-separated values. The first value is the
B value rounded to three decimal places and multiplied by 1000 (ranges
from 0-1000). The second value is the length of the segment in bp. For
example, the file chr10.bkgd begins with the lines: 
835 18021 
830 18467
824 18015 
This indicates that chromosome 10 begins with a run of 18021
bases with B value 0.835 followed by 18467 bases with B-value
0.830, etc.

Parameter values used to compute these B-values are from maximum 
likelihood estimates from 5-species (HCGOM) data for autosomes and 
2-species (HC) data for chromosome X.
