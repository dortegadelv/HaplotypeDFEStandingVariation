This repository contains all the scripts and programs used in our paper:

Haplotype-based inference of the distribution of fitness effects of segregating variants

Diego Ortega-Del Vecchyo, Kirk Lohmueller and John Novembre

## Programs included

We included these programs in the Programs/ folder:

1. PReFerSim.- We conducted forward simulations using PReFerSim. We include the version of PReFerSim we used in our paper with this repository (but see https://github.com/LohmuellerLab/PReFerSim for the latest version).
2. FoIS.- This program implements an importance sampling method developed by Monty Slatkin (2001, Genetics Research) to calculate the expected value of statistics from alleles that have a particular allele frequency in the present. The program can model any arbitrary demographic scenario.
